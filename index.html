    <p class="one" >A terminal pulses with a callous and ensnaring light. Revealing its paralysing fangs, it reaches for him and subtly bites in. </p>
    <p class="one" >Symbiosis.</p>
    <p class="one">Their DNA is not so different. The two have fused, neurons have become nodes and thoughts reduced to code. What was once user has now become admin—the prince has hatched.</p>
    
    <p class="one" >Entering the castle, he is greeted by columns of guards and herds of file types who have all been longing for his return. Behind them, a wide variety of hex codes shine prismatic waves to welcome him, signaling ecstasy and excitement. He continues forth, eagerly anticipating the sight and warm embrace of his love.

A pterodactyl coated in a cloak of chrome is seen flying off into the distance—the princess has been kidnapped. The prince, knowing how an incomplete binary will destroy the world, resigns himself to her rescue.</p>
