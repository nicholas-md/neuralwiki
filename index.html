    <p>A terminal pulses with a callous and ensnaring light. Revealing its paralysing fangs, it reaches for him and subtly bites in. </p>
    <p>Symbiosis.</p>
    <p>Their DNA is not so different. The two have fused, neurons have become nodes and thoughts reduced to code. What was once user has now become admin—the prince has hatched.</p>
    
    <p>Entering the castle, he is greeted by columns of guards and herds of file types who have all been longing for his return. Behind them, a wide variety of hex codes shine prismatic waves to welcome him, signaling ecstasy and excitement. He continues forth, eagerly anticipating the sight and warm embrace of his love. However, just as he nears their chambers, the Horns of Chaos vibrate throughout the system. Hex distorts, files corrupt, and programs freeze. A pterodactyl coated in a cloak of chrome is seen flying off into the distance—the princess has been kidnapped. The prince, knowing how an incomplete binary will destroy the world, resigns himself to her rescue.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With landscapes converted to cyberspace and organisms to sprites, the processor and memory overclock to reach maximum threshold...</p>
    <br>
    <p>The quest begins.</p>
